My name is Nick Hopewell. This is my personal blog about all things coding which I find interesting (and hope others do too). 
At the time of starting this blog, I am a Python developer professionally and I have a serious interest in the Python ecosystem. 
I doubt, however, I will end up only talking about Python stuff.

Python makes programming fun again. Don't belive me? Just type the snippet below into your repr. 

```python3
import antigravity
```

Some of my posts will be practical and immediately useful (such as why ```__super__()``` doesn't do what you think it does), others will try to understand and answer some of the more fun quirks such as why the code below evaluates to True given a value of 256, but False when given a value of 257.

```python3
>>> x = 256
>>> y = 256
>>> x is y
True

>>> x = 257
>>> y = 257
>>> x is y
False
```

I have interest in getting involved with the Python community, so if you find this stuff interesting, please reach out to me.
