My name is Nick and I love Python. This is my personal blog about all things coding and Python which I find interesting (and hope others do too). At the time of starting this blog, I am a Python developer professionally and I have a serious interest in the language and surrounding ecosystem.

Python makes programming fun again. Don't belive me? Just type ```import antigravity``` into your repr. 

Some of my posts will be practical and immediately useful (such as why ```__super__()``` doesn't do what you think it does), others will try to understand and answer some of the more fun quirks such as why the code below evaluates to True given a value of 256, but False when given a value of 257.

Find out why this is the case by [clicking here](https://nhopewell.github.io/import-this/2021/02/11/the-is-operator.html)

I have interest in getting involved with the Python community and I'd love to hear about your interests and journey to Python and/or coding in general. So if you find this stuff interesting, or just want to chat, please reach out to me.
