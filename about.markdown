My name is Nick and I love Python. This is my personal blog about all things Python and its surrounding ecosystem which I find interesting (and hope others do too). Python makes programming fun again. Don't belive me? Just type ```import antigravity``` into your repr. 

Some of my posts will be practical and immediately useful (such as <a href="https://nhopewell.github.io/import-this/2021/02/17/from-simple-namespaces-to-oop.html" target="_blank">this post</a>.) where I go on a journey from simple namespaces to object oriented programing. Other posts will try to understand and answer some of the more fun quirks such as why the code below evaluates to True given a value of 256, but False when given a value of 257.

Find out why this is the case by <a href="https://nhopewell.github.io/import-this/2021/02/11/the-is-operator.html" target="_blank">clicking here</a>

I have interest in getting involved with the Python community and I'd love to hear about your interests and journey to Python and/or coding in general. So if you find this stuff interesting, or just want to chat, please reach out to me.
